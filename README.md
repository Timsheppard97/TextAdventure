First attempt at a terminal text based adventure game that remembers users input to give them a variety of paths. 
The goal is to start small with 2 initial paths and eventually create a tree with many different branches that the player could have taken.
Leading to a potential of having a different playthrough on every restart

To run:
    -Download or Pull from github
    -open in VS code and simply type "python adventure.py" in the terminal
    -alternatively open in gitbash or cmd prompt, navigate to the correct folder and then type "python adventure.py"
